IMPORTANCE: The risk of developing epilepsy substantially increases after the
age of 60 years (late-onset epilepsy [LOE]), particularly in people with
cognitive decline ([PWCD] ie, dementia and/or mild cognitive impairment).
Epilepsy is associated with worse cognitive and mortality outcomes in PWCD.
Identifying PWCD at risk for developing LOE can facilitate early screening and
treatment of epilepsy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with LOE in PWCD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal, multicenter study is based
on participants from 39 US Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers from September
2005 through December 2021. Of 44 713 participants, 25 119 PWCD were identified.
Of these, 14 685 were included who did not have epilepsy at enrollment, had 2 or
more visits, and were 60 years or older at the most recent follow-up.
EXPOSURE: The association between various factors and LOE development in PWCD
was investigated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was LOE, defined as seizures
starting at or after 60 years of age. Those who did not develop LOE but were 60
years or older at follow-up served as controls. A multivariable Cox regression
analysis assessed the association between various factors and LOE. Independent
variables included age, sex, and socioeconomic factors (education, race,
ethnicity), cardiovascular risks (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia),
cerebrovascular disease (stroke or history of transient ischemic attack [TIA]),
other neurologic comorbidities (Parkinson disease [PD], traumatic brain injury),
cognition (age at dementia onset, dementia severity, type of dementia [Alzheimer
disease (AD) vs non-AD]), genetics (apolipoprotein E4 [APOE4] status), lifestyle
(alcohol misuse, smoking), and depression.
RESULTS: Of the 14 685 participants (7355 female [50%] and 7330 male [50%]; mean
[SD] age, 73.8 [8.5] years) who met the inclusion criteria, 221 participants
(1.5%) developed LOE during follow-up. After adjusting for demographics,
cardiovascular risks, neurologic comorbidities, genetics, cognitive factors, and
depression, the following were associated with a higher risk of developing LOE:
APOE4 allele (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04-1.86; P = .03),
dementia onset before age 60 years (aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.53-3.95; P < .001),
worse cognition (aHR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.97-2.79; P < .001), AD dementia subtype
(aHR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.13-2.49; P = .01), stroke/TIA (aHR, 2.03; 95% CI,
1.37-3.01; P < .001), and PD (aHR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.08-5.95; P = .03). In
sensitivity analysis, using an alternative LOE definition of epilepsy onset
after age 65 years revealed the same factors associated with LOE.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This study showed that the APOE4 allele, dementia
onset before age 60 years, AD dementia subtype, worse cognition, stroke/TIA, and
PD are associated with LOE development in PWCD. PWCD with these risk factors may
be considered for routine screening with an electroencephalogram for early
identification of LOE.

University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.
Primary cilia are polymodal sensory organelles which project from the apical
side of polarized cells. They are found in all brain hemispheres but are most
pronounced in neurons, which comprise the granular layers of the hippocampus and
cerebellum. Pathogenic variants in genes which encode primary cilia components
are responsible for neuronal ciliopathies-a group of central nervous system
disorders characterized by neurodevelopmental conditions such as intellectual
disability, seizure, ataxia, and sensory deficits. In the hippocampus, neuronal
primary cilia form chemical synapses with axons and their membranes are
populated with unique sets of ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs). Primary cilia are small and privileged compartments that are
challenging organelles to study. In detail, we describe cilia electrophysiology
methods and the use of cilia-specific fluorescent sensors to assay neuronal
polycystin channel function and serotonergic receptor signaling, respectively.
These tools allow researchers to assay calcium, cAMP and channel-related
signaling pathways in isolated neurons in real-time and in semi-quantitative
terms, while enhancing our understanding of this understudied organelle and its
dysregulation in ciliopathy disease states.

IMPORTANCE: Housing instability may worsen control of type 2 diabetes outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between stable vs unstable housing and
type 2 diabetes outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study analyzed electronic health
record data of adults with type 2 diabetes from US community-based health
centers from June 2016 to April 2023. Targeted minimum loss estimation was used
to examine the association between having vs not having housing instability and
subsequent type 2 diabetes outcomes, adjusting for age, date of housing
instability assessment, sex, race and ethnicity (social constructs that may
indicate the experience of racism), language, comorbidities, health insurance,
income, and census-tract level social vulnerability index. Analyses were
conducted from July 2023 to September 2024.
EXPOSURE: Report of housing stability or instability.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was the primary
outcome; secondary outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP
and DBP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The primary time point
was 12 months after initial assessment, with secondary time points at 6, 18, 24,
30, and 36 months.
RESULTS: A total of 90 233 individuals were included (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [13.7]
years; 50 772 female [56.3%]; 25 602 Black [28.4%], 27 277 Hispanic [31.4%],
51 720 White [57.3%]); 28 784 individuals (31.9%) had a primary language other
than English, and 15 713 (17.4%) reported housing instability. Prior to first
housing instability assessment, mean (SD) HbA1c was 7.64% (1.94%), mean (SD) SBP
was 130.0 (13.5) mm Hg, mean (SD) DBP was 78.2 (7.8) mm Hg, and mean (SD) LDL
cholesterol was 101.1 (35.2) mg/dL. We estimated had all individuals experienced
stable housing, compared with unstable housing, mean HbA1c would have been 0.12%
lower (95% CI, -0.16% to -0.07%; P < .001), SBP would have been 0.77 mm Hg lower
(95% CI, -1.14 mm Hg to -0.39 mm Hg; P < .001), and DBP 0.27 mm Hg lower (95%
CI, -0.49 mm Hg to -0.06 mm Hg; P = .01), but LDL cholesterol would not have
been lower (estimated difference, -1.46 mg/dL, 95% CI, -2.96 mg/dL to 0.03
mg/dL; P = .05) at 12 months, with numerically similar results at other time
points.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, housing stability was
associated with small differences in type 2 diabetes outcomes; combining housing
stability interventions with other diabetes interventions may be needed to
improve type 2 diabetes outcomes more substantially.

Cataracts: A Review.

IMPORTANCE: Age-related cataract, defined as progressive opacification or
clouding of the eye's natural lens, is a leading cause of visual disability and
blindness. Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed procedures in
high-income countries. More than 3.5 million cataract operations are performed
annually in the US.
OBSERVATIONS: Older age is the primary risk factor for cataracts, with
approximately two-thirds of the population older than 80 years affected. As the
population ages, the number of people with cataracts in the US is expected to
increase to 50 million by 2050. Additional risk factors for cataracts include a
hereditary or genetic predisposition, certain medications (corticosteroids),
ocular trauma, significant UV exposure or radiation therapy, and certain medical
conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, retinitis pigmentosa, Down syndrome,
and congenital rubella. Painless, progressive blurring of vision and visual
glare are common symptoms of cataracts. Cataracts are diagnosed during an eye
examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Surgery to remove the cataract
and implant a permanent intraocular lens (IOL) is indicated if visual impairment
impedes activities of daily living and is associated with lower rates of falls
(>30%) and dementia (20%-30%). Most cataract operations are performed with
topical anesthesia. Therefore, patients do not require preoperative general
medical testing such as bloodwork or electrocardiogram, and do not need to
discontinue anticoagulants for cataract surgery. Systemic α1-adrenergic
antagonists for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, such as tamsulosin,
increase the risk of surgical complications and some ophthalmologists
temporarily discontinue the drug preoperatively. Intraocular antibiotics, such
as moxifloxacin or cefuroxime, delivered intraoperatively have reduced the rates
of sight-threatening postsurgical endophthalmitis from 0.07% to 0.02%. In
addition to reversing and preventing progressive vision loss, cataract surgery
can reduce dependence on eyeglasses. These optional refractive benefits are
achieved with advanced technology IOL designs, such as multifocal IOLs. However,
multifocal and other advanced technology refractive IOLs are associated with
increased costs that are not covered by medical insurance.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cataracts are common among older adults and may cause
visual disability and blindness without treatment. Cataract surgery reverses and
prevents progressive vision loss, and advanced technology lens implants
facilitate reduced dependence on eyeglasses.

Background/Objectives: Giant pituitary adenomas (GPAs) pose significant surgical
challenges due to their large size, parasellar/suprasellar extensions, and
proximity to critical neurovascular structures. Although the endoscopic
endonasal approach (EEA) is preferred for pituitary tumors, achieving gross
total resection (GTR) in GPAs remains difficult. Additional transcranial
approaches may improve resection rates while minimizing morbidity. This study
evaluates the impact of endoscopic and combined surgical approaches on resection
outcomes using a classification system previously defined in GPA patients
treated over the past year. Methods: Among 517 pituitary adenomas treated in our
clinic between September 2023 and September 2024, 49 GPA patients underwent
endoscopic endonasal, transcranial, or combined surgery. Their medical records
and surgical videos were retrospectively reviewed. Data included demographics,
symptoms, imaging, surgical details, and follow-up outcomes. Tumor resection
rates were analyzed based on the "landmark-based classification", considering
radiological and pathological features and surgical approach. Results: The mean
age was 45.5 years (female/male: 14/35). Zone distribution was 8 (Zone 1), 21
(Zone 2), and 20 (Zone 3). GTR was achieved in 34.6%, near-total resection in
36.7%, and subtotal resection in 28.5%. Endoscopic surgery was performed in 41
patients, combined surgery in 7, and a transcranial approach in 1. Complications
included diabetes insipidus (9/49), cerebrospinal fluid leakage (2/49), apoplexy
(2/49), hypocortisolism (3/49), epidural hematoma (1/49), and epistaxis (1/49).
Conclusions: While EEA is effective for Zone 1 and 2 GPAs, Zone 3 tumors often
require combined or transcranial approaches for better resection. A multimodal
strategy optimizes tumor removal while minimizing morbidity. Individualized
surgical planning based on tumor classification is crucial for improving
outcomes.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cancer survivors increasingly face cardiovascular disease
(CVD), with diabetes as a major risk factor. This study investigates the
relationship between adherence to antidiabetic medications and cardiovascular
(CV) outcomes in cancer patients.
METHODS: Using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National
Sample Cohort, we assessed the clinical outcomes of adult cancer patients
prescribed antidiabetic medications. The study population was categorized based
on medication adherence, as determined by the medication possession ratio (MPR):
good (MPR ≥ 0.8), moderate (0.5 ≤ MPR < 0.8), and poor (MPR < 0.5) adherence.
The primary outcomes included overall and CV mortality, with secondary outcomes
encompassing hospitalization for major CVDs and healthcare costs.
RESULTS: Among the 7928 cancer patients with diabetes, 59.7% were nonadherent
(22.1% with moderate and 37.6% with poor adherence). Over a median follow-up of
5.7 years, 1462 deaths and 2897 CV events were confirmed. Multivariable adjusted
analyses showed a 1.70-fold and 2.11-fold higher risk of overall mortality for
the moderate and poor adherence groups, respectively, compared to the good
adherence group. For CV mortality, moderate adherence was associated with a
1.51-fold higher risk, and poor adherence with a 2.10-fold higher risk. The risk
for new-onset CV events increased by 1.32-fold in the moderate adherence group
and 1.44-fold in the poor adherence group. The good adherence group also showed
significantly lower total healthcare costs compared to the nonadherence group.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study underscores the importance of adherence to
antidiabetic medications in cancer patients, revealing significant associations
with decreased mortality, CV events, and healthcare costs.

Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced pancreatic injury (ICI-PI) is a
rare immunotoxicity, with limited data on treatment and long-term outcomes.
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for
studies reporting ICI-PI in patients with solid malignancies. ICI-PI was defined
as pancreatic inflammation post-ICI exposure, diagnosed via radiologic changes
or elevated lipase/amylase levels without other underlying causes. The CTCAE
grading system was used. The primary objectives were to assess the frequency,
severity, serum abnormalities, management, and long-term outcomes. We conducted
a proportional single-arm meta-analysis with a random effects model. Results:
The analysis included 25 retrospective studies involving 48,704 patients. Tumor
types included thoracic/head and neck (38%), skin (26%),
genitourinary/gynecological (18%), gastrointestinal (12%), and others (6%). The
median age ranged from 56 to 73 years, with a follow-up from 2.5 to 45.9 months.
ICI-PI occurred in 3.60% (95% CI: 1.64-6.28%) of patients, with grade ≥ 3
toxicity in 59.45% (95% CI: 35.32-81.37%). The frequency rates of ICI-PI were
1.99% for CTLA4 inhibitors, 5.01% for PD(L)1 inhibitors, and 7.44% for
combination ICI therapy (p < 0.01). The median time to onset from treatment
initiation ranged from 30 to 390 days, and symptom resolution ranged from 55 to
84 days. Management included corticosteroids (30.20%), intravenous fluids
(22.82%), and hospitalization (30.46%). Chronic complications affected 63.54%
(95% CI: 29.03-91.56%), including primarily diabetes mellitus (DM 89.45%; 95%
CI: 61.88-100.0%) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI 10.55%; 95%:
0.0-38.12%). ICI-PI recurrence occurred in 27.2% of those resuming ICI therapy.
The objective response rate was 61.7% (95% CI: 55.08-68.17%). Conclusions:
ICI-PI, though infrequent, is severe and predisposes patients to chronic
complications, including DM and EPI.

Cancer is complex because of the critical imbalance in genetic regulation as
characterized by both the overexpression of oncogenes (OGs), mainly through
mutations, amplifications, and translocations, and the inactivation of
tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs), which entail the preservation of genomic
integrity by inducing apoptosis to counter the malignant growth. Reviewing the
intricate molecular interplay between OGs and TSGs draws attention to their cell
cycle, apoptosis, and cancer metabolism regulation. In the present review, we
discuss seminal discoveries, such as Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, which framed
the field's understanding of cancer genetics, leading to the next breakthroughs
with next-generation sequencing and epigenetic profiling, revealing novel
insights into OG and TSG dysregulation with opportunities for targeted therapy.
The key pathways, such as MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and Wnt/β-catenin, are
presented in the context of tumor progression. Importantly, we further
highlighted the advances in therapeutic strategies, including inhibitors of KRAS
and MYC and restoration of TSG function, despite which mechanisms of resistance
and tumor heterogeneity pose daunting challenges. A high-level understanding of
interactions between OG-TSGs forms the basis for effective, personalized cancer
treatment-something to strive for in better clinical outcomes. This synthesis
should integrate foundational biology with translation and, in this case,
contribute to the ongoing effort against cancer.

Perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) exhibits particular morphological features, with
its activity being mainly related to thermogenesis. However, an expanded PRAT
area seems to play a significant role in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
mellitus, and chronic kidney disease pathogenesis. Numerous studies have
demonstrated that PRAT may support cancer progression and invasion, mainly in
obese patients. The mechanism underlying these processes is of dysregulation of
PRAT's secretion of adipokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as leptin,
adiponectin, chemerin, apelin, omentin-1, vistatin, nesfatin-1, and other
pro-inflammatory cytokines, modulated by tumor cells. Cancer cells may also
induce a metabolic reprogramming of perirenal adipocytes, leading to increased
lipids and lactate transfer to the tumor microenvironment, contributing to
cancer growth in a hypoxic milieu. In addition, the PRAT browning process has
been specifically detected in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), being characterized by
upregulated expression of brown/beige adipocytes markers (UCP1, PPAR-ɣ, c/EBPα,
and PGC1α) and downregulated white fat cells markers, such as LEPTIN, SHOX2,
HOXC8, and HOXC9. Considering its multifaceted role in cancer, modulation of
PRAT's role in tumor progression may open new directions for oncologic therapy
improvement. Considering the increasing evidence of the relationship between
PRAT and tumor cells, our review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the
perirenal adipocytes' impact on tumor progression and metastasis.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogenous condition that is estimated
to effect up to 21% of reproductive aged people with ovaries. In previous work,
a dataset of PCOS features was derived from approximately 100,000 PCOS subreddit
users via machine learning. In this study, an exploration of treatment response
within the PCOS subreddit was undertaken with the derived dataset. The treatment
or symptom features in the dataset had sentiment labels indicating when a
treatment was perceived to improve or worsen a condition or symptom. When
different features were mentioned within two sentences of each other without
conflicting sentiment, it could be assumed that they were related. This
assumption allowed for a broad analysis of the perceived effect of popular
treatments on the most frequently mentioned symptoms. In general, lifestyle
changes and supplements were the most positively regarded, while contraceptives
were frequently associated with considerable negative sentiment. For PCOS weight
loss, unspecified dieting (RR 5.19, 95% CI 3.28-8.19, n = 99) and intermittent
fasting (RR 33.50, 95% CI 8.54-131.34, n = 69) were the most successful
interventions. Inositol was associated with a large range of favourable outcomes
and was one of the few treatments associated with improved mental health
[depression (RR 4.25, 95% CI 1.72-10.51, n = 21), anxiety (RR 5.83, 95% CI
2.76-12.35, n = 41) and mood issues (RR 25.00, 95% CI 3.65-171.10, n = 26)].
Combined oral contraceptive pills as a whole were strongly associated with
adverse effects such as worsening depression (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.25,
n = 33), anxiety (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.36, n = 23), fatigue (RR 0, n = 45) and
low libido (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.24, n = 30). However, combined contraceptives
with anti-androgenic progestins were associated with more favourable
experiences. This study demonstrates the utility of machine learning to derive
measurable patient experience data from an internet forum. While patient
experience data derived using machine learning is not a substitute for
traditional clinical trials, it is useful for mass validation and hypothesis
generation. This paper may serve as the first exploration into this category of
clinical internet forum research.
