Health risks associated with infertility and non-obstructive azoospermia.

Non-obstructive azoospermia is a common condition associated with significant health risks, including increased mortality, cancer, and chronic diseases such as metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. This review aims to highlight the potential health challenges faced by men with this condition compared to fertile counterparts. Through a comprehensive bibliographic search on PubMed, using the following algorithm: ("infertility, male" [MeSH Terms] OR "azoospermia" [MeSH Terms]) AND ("mortality" [MeSH Terms] OR "neoplasms" [MeSH Terms] OR "chronic disease" [MeSH Terms] OR "diabetes mellitus" [MeSH Terms] OR "heart diseases" [MeSH Terms]), we analyzed existing literature to explore the associations between infertility, specifically azoospermia, and adverse health outcomes. Findings indicate that infertile men are at a higher risk of death, various cancers (particularly testicular cancer), metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypogonadism, and cardiovascular disease. Although research specifically addressing azoospermia is limited, available studies support the notion that men with this condition may experience heightened health vulnerabilities. Given these risks, it is imperative for healthcare professionals, especially urologists, to conduct thorough health assessments for men diagnosed with azoospermia. Informing patients of these potential health issues and integrating comprehensive evaluations into their care can facilitate early detection and intervention for life-threatening conditions. Ultimately, men with azoospermia should receive ongoing monitoring to address their specific health concerns, thus improving their long-term health outcomes.

Closed-loop therapy: recent advancements and potential predictors of glycemic outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Hybrid closed-loop systems have become the standard of care for managing type 1 diabetes (T1D). Both clinical trials and real-world data have demonstrated that these systems improve glycemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, while also reducing the overall burden of T1D management. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed for studies including individuals with T1D that were published until the end of 2024. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we summarize the safety and efficacy of currently available hybrid closed-loop systems, drawing from key clinical trials and real-world data analyses. We also highlight recent advancements in closed-loop systems, discuss their limitations and barriers to access, and explore future directions for automated insulin delivery. Finally, we explore potential predictors of outcomes for people with T1D to better understand why some individuals respond better to closed-loop systems than others. EXPERT OPINION: Closed-loop systems are advancing rapidly, with a growing focus on enhancing automation through fully closed-loop systems to improve glycemic control and further reduce the burden of management. Identifying the predictors that influence how individuals respond to closed-loop therapy will enable these systems to be optimized. It is crucial to ensure widespread and equitable access to this advanced technology.

Phenotypic and genetic diversity in diabetes across populations.

Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous condition with substantial clinical variability across global populations. The standard classification of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is primarily based on phenotypic characteristics in European-ancestry populations. However, diabetes exhibits diverse phenotypes in other populations, including a varied relationship between diabetes risk and body mass index. These differences may be partly attributable to genetic variation among populations. Understanding and leveraging this genetic variation can aid in the development of precision medicine approaches to diabetes diagnosis and treatment, ultimately helping to reduce healthcare disparities in diabetes among minoritized populations.

Assessment of the Knowledge of Chronic Kidney Disease and Anemia Among University Students in Ghana: A Cross-Sectional Study.

Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is typically associated with anemia, with both implicated in global mortalities and morbidities. Adequate knowledge about these conditions might help individuals to prevent and/or manage them effectively. This study was aimed at assessing the knowledge of CKD and anemia regarding their causes, risk factors, and preventive practices among undergraduate students. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional design conducted from July 2023 to September 2023, involving 267 students pursuing either health-related or nonhealth-related programs. A structured questionnaire was administered to participants to assess their knowledge of CKD and anemia and was analyzed. Results: An overwhelming majority, 208 (77.9%), demonstrated a good level of general knowledge of CKD, whereas an even higher proportion, 215 (80.5%), had a good level of general knowledge of anemia. Also, the bulk of the participants, 222 (83.1%), showed a good level of knowledge of the relationship between CKD and anemia. There was a significant relationship between a student's faculty and general CKD knowledge (p < 0.001). Participants in health-related faculties and in the third/fourth year significantly had good knowledge of CKD than those in nonhealth-related faculties and in the first/second year of studies. With regards to anemia, individuals aged 20 years and beyond had good knowledge of anemia than teenage students. There was also a significant relationship between a student's faculty and general knowledge of anemia (p < 0.001), such that participants in health-related faculties were about 99% less likely to have poor knowledge of anemia than those in nonhealth-related faculties [AOR = 0.01 (0.00, 0.007)]. Conclusion: Students with good knowledge of CKD, anemia, and/or their interrelationships were the majority. However, students in health-related faculties significantly had good knowledge of both CKD and anemia than their counterparts in nonhealth-related faculties. Health-related courses that would enlighten students in nonhealth-related faculties should be promoted.

Gallium-68-DOTATATE PET/CT for phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor localization in suspected tumor-induced osteomalacia.

Gallium-68-DOTA-Tyr3-Octreotate (Ga-68-DOTATATE) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has recently been shown to have utility for the localization of phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMT) that cause tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a rare renal phosphate-wasting disorder. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT in localizing PMTs causing TIO and to compare its performance with other functional imaging modalities. Prospective recruitment and retrospective chart review of 30 patients with suspected TIO and evaluation with Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT between 2017 and 2023 were conducted at a tertiary medical center. True positive (TP) lesions were defined by histological confirmation of PMT. There were 22 TP lesions identified among 18 patients, with a mean SUV(max) of 16.8 (+/-10.9). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT were 85.7%, 77.8%, and 83.3% on patient-based analysis, and 84.6%, 56.3%, and 73.8% on lesion-based analysis. Lesions such as subacute fractures, parathyroid adenomas, thymus uptake, vertebral hemangiomas, bone enchondromas, liver hemangiomas, and avascular necrosis were some of the pitfalls in interpretation. Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT led to a significant impact on clinical management in 24 (80%) of patients. The presence of DOTATATE-avid fractures was significantly associated with a localizing scan on univariable (OR 15.0, 95% CI 2.80-110, p = .001) and multivariable analysis (OR 9.45, 95% CI 1.33-98.4, p = .003). Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT has good accuracy for the localization of TIO, with superior sensitivity compared to F-18-FDG PET/CT. This significantly impacted clinical treatment decisions. Although DOTATATE-avid fractures may be a source of false positives, they may also indicate a higher probability of a localizing study.

Improvement in breast cancer survival across molecular subtypes in Hungary between 2011 and 2020: a nationwide, retrospective study.

BACKGROUND: Despite well-documented clinical differences across breast-cancer (BC) molecular subtypes and relevant changes in therapeutic interventions over the past decades, there remains a significant lack of up-to-date epidemiologic data and real-world outcomes, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. METHODS: This was a nationwide, retrospective study using the claims databases of the Hungarian National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) that included patients who were newly diagnosed with BC between 2011 and 2020. BC subtypes were defined based on the therapies received. Overall survival (OS) and net survival rates were calculated. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2020, 74,143 patients were newly diagnosed with BC based on ICD-10 diagnostic codes in the NHIF database and 80.1% of the cases could be classified into subtypes based on therapy. The most common subtype was HER2-/HR+ BC, identified in 61.9% of patients, followed by triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in 8.4%, HER2+/HR+ BC in 6.2%, and HER2+/HR- BC in 3.6% of cases. The proportions of TNBC and HER2+/HR+ were higher among younger patients, than in elderly cohorts. The 5-year OS of the total BC population was 74.2% in patients diagnosed between 2015-2019. Patients with TNBC had the poorest 5-year OS (TNBC: 61.4%; HER2+/HR+: 86.5%; HER2-/HR+: 79.1%; HER2+/HR-: 71.9%). Net survival rates (i.e. survival rates after adjusting the effects of other causes of death) varied across diagnostic periods and molecular subtypes. In most cases, patients diagnosed later during the study period tended to have numerically better survival rates. Patients with HER2-/HR+ BC had the most favorable net survival, with 5-year net survival exceeding 92% during the whole observation period, while TNBC patients had the lowest 5-year net survival rates ranging between 63.6% and 65.8% during the study period. CONCLUSION: Our nationwide study describes the distribution and survival of BC patients with different subtypes based on a retrospective analysis of the health insurance fund database. There remains a significant room for improvement in the survival of more aggressive molecular subtypes including HR-/HER2+ and triple-negative BC, which are more common in younger age cohorts.

Non-communicable disease burden through adhering to Dutch dietary guidelines: a modeling study to estimate future reductions.

BACKGROUND: Non-optimal food consumption is a major modifiable risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We aimed to estimate the potential reductions in NCD burden that could be achieved in 2050 by adhering to eleven components of the Dutch dietary guidelines in the Netherlands. METHODS: Counterfactual scenarios, in which the entire Dutch population adhered to components of the dietary guidelines, were implemented to estimate future reductions in NCD burden using the DYNAMO-HIA software. Input data included nationally-representative food consumption data (Dutch National Food Consumption Survey 2012-2016), relative risks of food consumption on NCDs, Dutch NCD epidemiology, and the Dutch population structure. FINDINGS: Adhering to processed meat (0 g/d) and fruit (>/=200 g/d) recommendations showed the largest reductions. By 2050, eliminating processed meat consumption could reduce per 100,000 population cases of coronary heart disease by 18.5% (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 3.9%, 36.2%) in women and 23.8% (95% UI: 5.7%, 44.1%) in men, type 2 diabetes by 18.6% (95% UI: 11.6%, 27.4%) in women and 24.5% (95% UI: 15.3%, 35.4%) in men, and colorectal cancer by 8.7% (95% UI: 5.1%, 13.0%) in women and 10.4% (95% UI: 5.0%, 16.4%) in men. Adhering to fruit recommendation could reduce stroke cases by 17.7% (95% UI: 11.1%, 21.9%) in women and 19.1% (95% UI: 12.2%, 23.4%) in men, and lung cancer cases by 8.2% (95% UI: 4.4%, 12.8%) in women and 7.2% (95% UI: 3.4%, 12.0%) in men. Eliminating processed meat could increase life expectancy at age 50 by 0.310 (95% UI: 0.181, 0.453) years for women and 0.724 (95% UI: 0.398, 1.092) years for men, and disease-free life expectancy by 1.554 (95% UI: 1.032, 2.189) years for women and 2.494 (95% UI: 1.627, 3.504) years for men. INTERPRETATION: Our model suggests that adhering to Dutch dietary guidelines could reduce future NCD burden in the Netherlands. Reducing processed meat and increasing fruit consumption should be priority prevention targets. FUNDING: This project has received funding from the Dutch Science Agenda (NWA) program 'Transition Towards a Sustainable Food System' funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO): NWA.1235.18.201.

County-level association of diabetes and obesity with premature mortality.

OBJECTIVE: The association between the prevalence of diabetes and obesity and premature mortality at the county-level has not been well characterized. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between county-level prevalence of diabetes and obesity and premature mortality. METHODS: We utilized the data from the 2022 County Health Rankings which obtained the data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2019, and National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Files 2018-2020. The county prevalence of diabetes and obesity was determined, and univariable and multivariable associations with premature mortality were identified. RESULTS: Among 3082 counties, the percentage of individuals with diabetes ranged from 5.5 to 21.0 % and the percentage of individuals with obesity ranged from 16.4 to 51.0 %. Our analysis revealed a stepwise increase in premature age-adjusted death rates (AADR) with rising deciles of county-level diabetes (P < 0.001) and obesity (P < 0.001) in both univariable and multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the significance of addressing diabetes and obesity at the county-level to reduce premature mortality and improve population health outcomes across varied communities in the United States.

Versatile and Marvelous Potentials of Polydeoxyribonucleotide for Tissue Engineering and Regeneration.

Over the past decade, substantial focus has been placed on polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) due to its promising pharmacological properties, making it a valuable candidate for tissue engineering applications. Accordingly, this paper aims to review and summarize the latest experimental research on PDRN in the context of tissue engineering and regeneration. The unique biochemical mechanisms of PDRN to promote cellular behavior and regeneration are summarized. We categorize commonly utilized PDRN-based tissue engineering fields as neuromuscular tissues, diabetic wound or skin, and bone regeneration. At the same time, we explore scaffold strategies for integrating PDRN into bioceramics, polymers, and cell/tissue-derived materials, along with its combination with photo/electromodulation techniques. Furthermore, we discuss potential opportunities and challenges in translating PDRN-based approaches into clinical practice. We expect future interdisciplinary research and clinical trials to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of PDRN while emphasizing standardization and quality control to ensure its consistency and effectiveness in regenerative applications.

Diabetic ketoacidosis treatment outcomes and associated factors among adult diabetic patients in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis is a severe complication of diabetes that can threaten life and has a considerable effect on healthcare systems, especially in developing nations such as Ethiopia. Although it is clinically significant, comprehensive data on the factors that lead to unsatisfactory treatment outcomes in diabetic ketoacidosis patients in Ethiopia are lacking. This review aims to investigate and evaluate unsatisfactory treatment outcomes and multiple contributing factors related to diabetic ketoacidosis among patients with diabetes in Ethiopia. This review seeks to identify these factors to provide insights that can guide improvements in the management and treatment of diabetic patients. METHODS: Articles documenting unfavorable treatment outcomes and related aspects of diabetic ketoacidosis among Ethiopian diabetes patients were meticulously sought from various databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Science Direct, HINARI, Google Scholar, and gray literature. After the data were extracted, they were imported into Stata software version 17 for analysis. The Cochrane Q test and I(2) statistic were used to evaluate heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 580 duplicates were eliminated from the initial set of 1578 papers obtained from PubMed (3), Google Scholar (1,550), HINARI (11), Science Direct (13), and the Cochrane Library (1). The pooled prevalence of poor treatment outcomes for diabetic ketoacidosis was 8 %. Key risk factors for poor treatment outcomes included a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of less than 15 (POR = 3.16; 95 % CI: 1.52-4.80), sepsis (POR = 2.92; 95 % CI: 1.12-4.72), and comorbidities (POR = 3.66; 95 % CI: 1.64-5.68). CONCLUSION: The pooled prevalence of poor treatment outcomes of diabetic ketoacidosis in Ethiopia was high. A GCS score of less than 15, sepsis, and comorbidities were identified as significant risk factors for poor treatment outcomes in diabetic ketoacidosis patients. Addressing and minimizing these factors could help reduce the incidence of poor treatment outcomes in diabetic ketoacidosis patients in Ethiopia.
